```
Samples -> CD45-barcoded Samples: CD45 antibody conjugated to isotope
CD45-barcoded Samples -> Pooled Samples: Immuno Profiling Panel
Pooled Samples -> Fluidigm CyTOF:  Cell injector + calibration Beads
Fluidigm CyTOF -> Data acquisition software: Pre-processing
Data acquisition software -> Data acquisition software: Bead Normalization
Data acquisition software -> Data acquisition software: Bead Exclusion
Data acquisition software -> Data acquisition software: Enrich for singlets and viable cells
Data acquisition software -> Data acquisition software: CD45 deconvolution
Data acquisition software -> CIDC : CIMAC upload raw FCS files
CIDC -> Astrolable : Standardized processing Pipeline
Astrolable -> Astrolable : Clustering/Analysis
Astrolable -> CIDC : Store processed FCS files
Astrolable -> CIDC : Store Analyzed files

## Files to be uploaded to CIDC by CIMAC <a name="uploads"></a>

- Raw FCS- Files generated by the CyTOF machine after normalization, bead exclusion and CD45 deconvolution.
- Sample metadata- Tab delimited file with following columns:
    * Filename
    * Sample ID
    * Patient ID
    * Condition (Tumor/Normal)
    * Any additional feature (Timepoint, Treatment etc)
- Experiment metadata
    * Instrument name
